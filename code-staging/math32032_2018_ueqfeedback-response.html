<h2>Yuri's response to unit evaluation questionnaires which the students filled in in May 2018</h2>
<p><em>A version of this document was published in the student feedback section
of the School of Mathematics website</em></p>
<p>This was the second year Coding Theory course ran in a new format: it is
now being taught in Semester 2. As a result, there are more teaching
hours; and I expect the students to be more experienced, compared to
Semester 1. After all, for most students taking MATH32032, this is the
final semester of their degree course.</p>
<p>The course was taken by slightly more than 150 students. Most students
kindly responded to the Unit Evaluation Questionnaire. Judging by the
very high scores the course received in the UEQs (see below), the
format, the content and the intellectual level of the course were
well-pitched. I thank this year’s students for helping to make the
course a success.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The feedback on my work was helpful</strong>: <strong>4.88 out of 5</strong> (agree: 89%, agree or mostly agree: 99%).</p>
<p><strong>The support classes were helpful</strong>: <strong>4.78 out of 5</strong> (agree: 80%, a/ma: 99%)</p>
<p>Students’ responses praised feedback quizzes held in the tutorials,
which helped to monitor the students’ progress and even receive
individual feedback by e-mail. Feedback on written coursework was also
rated favourably. Criticism:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>too much coursework for 20% of the final mark</em>: I think that for most
students coursework was a very useful means to understand the essential
content early on. Only one half of coursework was written, the other
half was an online test which many re-took to improve marks, which in
itself was a great stimulus to learn and to revise everything.</li>
<li><em>the online quiz was too formulaic and easy</em>: Formulaic – yes, there
is a number of simple but essential fomulas to learn and to use; easy –
well, only 2 students managed to get full marks from the first attempt!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The unit was well organised</strong>: <strong>4.93 out of 5</strong> (agree: 93%, a/ma:
100%)</p>
<p>Criticism: <em>the tablet used for lectures sometimes had to be restarted,
wasting some minutes</em>. True (though not much was lost), the tablet is
getting old – I’ll try to use the high UEQ scores to persuade the
department to buy me a new tablet!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The course materials were helpful</strong>: <strong>4.90 out of 5</strong> (agree: 90%, a/ma:
100%)</p>
<p>Students’ responses commended the availability of podcasts, lecture
notes and past exam papers. I will continue to provide these materials
to students. Criticism: <em>sometimes, problems for the examples class and
their solutions were uploaded late</em> – to address this, I will make
problems a part of lecture notes (at the end of each chapter) and will
streamline the process of releasing the model solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The eLearning resources were helpful</strong>: <strong>4.85 out of 5</strong> (agree: 88%, a/ma:
98%)</p>
<p>The Blackboard-based online test was well-received, although see
criticism above. I am working on incorporating Maple TA quizzes into
coursework; they are more difficult to set up but will hopefully provide
more varied opportunities for online testing and feedback.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The lecturer’s teaching was excellent</strong>: <strong>4.82 out of 5</strong> (agree:
83%, a/ma: 99%)</p>
<p>I am grateful for excellent feedback on this. No specific issues other
than mentioned above, although I was not afraid to be somewhat
provocative or controversial – all to encourage students to think and to
engage!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Overall, I would rate this unit as excellent</strong>: <strong>4.75 out of
5</strong> (agree: 78%, a/ma: 98%)</p>
<p>Thank you. The high satisfaction score encourages me to continue
offering intellectual challenge to students and to uphold standards. It
is challenging, hard maths we should be – and are – teaching in the
final year, and I believe that good results must not be achievable
without a genuine effort and hard work.</p>
