<h2>by Yuri Bazlov</h2>
<p><strong>1. My message to the 2017/18 students</strong></p>
<p><strong>This was the second year in which MATH10101 ran in a refreshed format.</strong>
Prof. Nige Ray taught the 1st half of the course; my feedback relates
to the 2nd half which I taught. This year, I made slight changes to the
content in order to better harmonise it with the material on
Cryptography the students were working on in MATH10001 Mathematical
Workshop.</p>
<p><strong>I was truly impressed by your enthusiasm and your motivation.</strong>
Quite a
number of students were active in the classroom, asking questions and
making comments. Even more students got in touch with me by email from
time to time. This definitely helped me to gauge the level of
understanding and to adjust the pace. Here is some advice you may find
useful in the rest of your degree course:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Don’t be shy, ask even more questions and make even more comments
to your lecturers. Remember, there is no such thing as a stupid
question.</li>
<li>Start revising the material early: if the lectures finish in
mid-December, don’t wait until January. Make more use of the Forum on
Blackboard to ask revision questions. Early questions asked in the Forum
allowed me to give detailed responses with extra examples; this is
easier, and more useful, than a quick answer a day or two before the
exam.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In the questionnaire,</strong> you were asked to indicate how strongly you agree with statements
about the course, on a scale from 5 (agree), 4 (mostly agree) to 1
(disagree). I thank everyone who returned their feedback: two thirds of
students did so, making the feedback scores (see below) a reliable
indicator of how the course went. The responses were overwhelmingly
positive, with a lot of praise in the textual comments; here I will only
focus on 'What can be improved?’ comments specifically relevant to the
second half of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, I would rate this unit as being excellent: 4.4 out of 5
(agree: 53%, agree or mostly agree: 89%).</strong> Issued raised in the
questionnaires:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Too much content, hard to learn it all.</em> I’d say I could further
streamline the content of the second half of the course, but not
reduce the amount. Some of the material is needed for the Mathematical
Workshop, some required in subsequent courses, all is necessary for a
thorough introduction to mathematics and understanding modern
applications. Remember, this course expects you to invest 145 hours into
independent study during weeks 1-12. Also, you should use the revision
period more efficiently, see 1b above.</li>
<li><em>Exam practice could be introduced earlier on in the course.</em> In
fact, I like to use past exam questions for practice (not all
lecturers do). This year, only one Foundations of Pure Mathematics A
past exam paper was available. The more past papers are available, the
more past exam questions can be used in the course.</li>
<li><em>More examples/exercises on abstract concepts. More links between
the content covered in lectures and the content appearing on problem
sheets.</em> Good point. I’ll address it by highlighting the links between
the lecture material and the supervision problem sheets.</li>
<li><em>A recap on some of the earlier material at the end would be
useful.</em> Nice idea but difficult to implement given the setup with two
lecturers.</li>
<li><em>Do not give long proofs. Proofs are essential for understanding
mathematics.</em> Some proofs are long, although I am constantly improving
the structure of the course, including proofs.</li>
<li><em>Introduce more group theory.</em> I do not think that this is a good
idea – there are other beautiful things to learn in Foundations. Wait
until MATH20201 Algebraic Structures 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The feedback that I received on my work was helpful: 4.3 out of 5
(agree: 49%, a/ma: 84%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The support classes were helpful: 4.4 out of 5 (agree: 60%, a/ma:
88%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the 2nd half of the course, the weekly supervisions are the main
vehicle for feedback.</strong> Feedback was the only category where less than
50% chose to &quot;agree&quot;. We will need to improve this further.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>My supervisor was helpful/not helpful.</em> I cannot deal with these
comments anonymously – please get in touch with me, confidentially, to
discuss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The unit was well organised: 4.5 out of 5 (agree: 63%, a/ma: 93%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glad to see enthusiastic feedback here.</strong>
There is always an issue of
two 2-hour lectures vs. four 1-hour lectures (or a different split).
Overall, I feel that there is a slight balance in favour of the current
setup of 2-hour blocks (with breaks in the middle of each hour) as it
makes the unit more organised and streamlined.</p>
<p><strong>The course materials were helpful: 4.5 out of 5 (agree: 60%, a/ma:
95%)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Follow the PJE book more closely/Introduce more variation from the
PJE book.</em> Those comments 'cancel each other’. Overall, I think that
the course achieved a good balance.</li>
<li><em>Draft notes could be uploaded earlier.</em> Will do, but access to
draft notes before the lectures is a luxury which I happen to provide.
Copies of what I wrote in the lecture, as well as podcasts, were
available shortly after each lecture.</li>
<li><em>Set a long revision homework after the last week.</em> Interesting
idea. Past exam papers may also be used, although I don't mind giving
students as much work as they want.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The eLearning resources provided in this unit were helpful...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will not comment on this as virtually no eLearning resources were
provided.</strong> Online PDF notes and podcasts are not eLearning as they lack
interactivity. The only eLearning resource was the Forum on Blackboard
but it became really active only after the questionnaires closed. I
think that it would be useful to offer students lots of practice
questions via the Maple TA online software, and will work on that.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri Bazlov’s teaching was excellent: 4.6 out of 5 (agree: 64%, a/ma:
92%)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Bazlov’s lectures are hard to follow.</em> While I am pleased with the
feedback (my teaching was rated higher than any other aspect of the
course), I am constantly working to make my teaching even better.</li>
<li><em>Pace can be slowed down.</em> An isolated comment. Although there were
no suggestions that the pace was too slow, I think that overall, given
the availability of podcasts and of everything I wrote in a lecture as
PDF, my pace is about right.</li>
<li><em>Yuri, take teaching classes from Nigel.</em> I did! Nige led one of the
classes for new lecturers when I came to Manchester. Nige's teaching
of MATH10101 will no doubt be sorely missed – we all wish him happy
retirement.</li>
