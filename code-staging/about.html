What I write below will hopefully give you some further insight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-coding-theory-about">
<span id="about"></span><h2>What is Coding Theory about?</h2>
<p><em>Coding theory</em> is not about writing computer code, and is not about
cryptography. The purpose of coding theory is to generate mathematical
ideas and methods that can be used to <em>transmit information</em> more
reliably. The main concept of coding theory is <em>error correcting code</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-error-correction-needed">
<h2>Why is error correction needed?</h2>
<p>When information (message) is passed from a sender to a receiver, there
is a chance that some parts of that message are changed or lost. This is
often due to random noise  – think of atmospheric noise interfering with
radio transmision, gamma-ray bursts affecting satellite feed, crosstalk
in Ethernet cables, scratches on a DVD, etc. One would like to recover
the original message after it has been affected by noise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-can-one-possibly-correct-errors-in-the-transmitted-messages">
<h2>How can one possibly correct errors in the transmitted messages?</h2>
<p>One wants to design messages in such a way that they are &quot;far&quot; from each
other. Then, if a message is changed slightly, it still does not
coincide with any other message, and can be recovered.
The precise meaning of &quot;far&quot; can be formalised in terms of <em>Hamming
distance</em>, but here is an easy example.</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-example">
<p class="first admonition-title">Example</p>
<p class="last">Suppose that we want to transmit one of the two messages: 0 (NO) or 1
(YES). If we send just one bit, 0 or 1, it can arrive corrupted so that
NO changes to YES and vice versa – there is no way to know that an error
occurred. We will transmit the <em>codeword</em> 00000 for NO and the codeword
11111 for YES. That way, because it is much less likely that more than
two bits will change in a transmitted codeword due to noise, the
received word 01000 can be fairly safely interpreted to mean NO.</p>
</div>
<p>We have just seen an example of an error correcting code called
<em>repetition code</em>, which is quite inefficient: we had to send five bits
instead of one. In the course, we will see how to design much more
efficient codes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-mathematical-ideas-are-used-to-design-codes">
<h2>What mathematical ideas are used to design codes?</h2>
<p>We will use <em>algebra</em> and, to some extent, <em>geometry</em> and <em>logic</em> to do
this, and will have to work with vectors, matrices and projective spaces
over finite fields, polynomials and the Boolean algebra. We will prove
general facts about codes. We will also see some codes which were used
by NASA to transmit messages to the deep space missions, and codes used
in modern telecommunication networks, alongside more peculiar historical
applications of codes in sports betting.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, while the above serves as a background or
motivation to the study of codes, all the examinable material in this
course is purely mathematical. Students' knowledge of electrical
engineering or sports will not be assessed.</p>

<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>You can find a brief syllabus of MATH32032 in the official <a class="reference external" href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2019/00590/bsc-mathematics/course-details/MATH32032#course-unit-details">course
description</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intended-learning-outcomes-ilo">
<h2>Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO)</h2>
<p>Just following the lectures is great, but
you should be able to assess how well you mastered the course – and
we should be able to assess you. The University wants us to use
a list of things you should be able to <em>do</em> – the ILO – and the assessment
must be organised around them.
As from 2018, model solutions to <a class="reference external" href="feedback.html#past-papers">past papers</a> refer to the
following ILO.</p>
<p><em>On successful completion of the Coding Theory course, students should be
able to:</em></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Define and illustrate main concepts and prove fundamental theorems concerning
error-correcting codes given in the course;</li>
<li>calculate the parameters of given codes and their dual codes using
standard matrix and polynomial operations;</li>
<li>encode and decode information by applying algorithms associated with
well-known codes;</li>
<li>compare the error-detecting/correcting facilities of given codes for
a given binary symmetric channel;</li>
<li>design simple linear or cyclic codes with required properties;</li>
<li>solve mathematical problems involving error-correcting codes by
linking them to concepts from elementary number theory,
combinatorics, linear algebra and elementary calculus.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="how-to-succeed-in-math32032-and-how-not-to-succeed">
<h2>How to succeed in MATH32032 (and how not to succeed!)</h2>
<p>The following advice is based on my past experience of teaching this course.</p>
<p><strong>Typically, successful students:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>attended all lectures and examples classes;</li>
<li>asked questions - in class, on the <a class="reference external" href="feedback.html#online-discussion-forum">Online Discussion Forum</a>, by email,
in my office hour;</li>
<li>took part in the <a class="reference external" href="feedback.html#feedback-quizzes">feedback quizzes</a> which I organised in the examples
classes and handed in their quizzes to receive feedback from me or my
teaching assistant;</li>
<li>attempted the <a class="reference external" href="index.html#exercises-and-solutions">exercises</a> <strong>in advance of</strong> examples classes;</li>
<li>invested a lot of time and effort in the <a class="reference external" href="feedback.html#midterm-coursework">midterm coursework</a> and then acted
upon my feedback on their work;</li>
<li>invested time and effort in the <a class="reference external" href="feedback.html#online-test">online test</a> and carefully read feedback provided online;</li>
<li>started revising the exam material <strong>already during the Easter break</strong>, for example
by attempting <a class="reference external" href="feedback.html#past-papers">past papers</a>, and raised meaningful queries
during the last two weeks of the semester.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are some things done by past students who were not successful:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Students did not learn the language of Coding Theory (i.e., definitions) and lost many marks in the exam
because they could not reproduce definitions and failed to understand the questions on the exam paper.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Students collaborated on the <a class="reference external" href="feedback.html#midterm-coursework">midterm coursework</a> which led to me reporting them to the Faculty
for academic malpractice, and sanctions being applied (as a minimum, zero marks for the coursework).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Students who ignored my (written or audio) feedback on their midterm coursework and repeated their
mistakes in the final exam.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Students who did not know one or more of the following basic topics well and did not care to brush up their knowledge
during the semester:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Linear algebra</li>
<li>Addition and multiplication modulo <em>p</em></li>
<li>Powers of 2 and binomial coefficients</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that you <strong>are not</strong> one of these students!</p>
