<div class="section" id="what-is-coding-theory-about">
<span id="about"></span><h2>What is Coding Theory about?</h2>
<p><em>Coding theory</em> is not about writing computer code, and is not about
cryptography. The purpose of coding theory is to generate mathematical
ideas and methods that can be used to <em>transmit information</em> more
reliably. The main concept of coding theory is <em>error correcting code</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-error-correction-needed">
<h2>Why is error correction needed?</h2>
<p>When information (message) is passed from a sender to a receiver, there
is a chance that some parts of that message are changed or lost. This is
often due to random noise  – think of atmospheric noise interfering with
radio transmision, gamma-ray bursts affecting satellite feed, crosstalk
in Ethernet cables, scratches on a DVD, etc. One would like to recover
the original message after it has been affected by noise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-can-one-possibly-correct-errors-in-the-transmitted-messages">
<h2>How can one possibly correct errors in the transmitted messages?</h2>
<p>One wants to design messages in such a way that they are &quot;far&quot; from each
other. Then, if a message is changed slightly, it still does not
coincide with any other message, and can be recovered.
The precise meaning of &quot;far&quot; can be formalised in terms of <em>Hamming
distance</em>, but here is an easy example.</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-example">
<p class="first admonition-title">Example</p>
<p class="last">Suppose that we want to transmit one of the two messages: 0 (NO) or 1
(YES). If we send just one bit, 0 or 1, it can arrive corrupted so that
NO changes to YES and vice versa – there is no way to know that an error
occurred. We will transmit the <em>codeword</em> 00000 for NO and the codeword
11111 for YES. That way, because it is much less likely that more than
two bits will change in a transmitted codeword due to noise, the
received word 01000 can be fairly safely interpreted to mean NO.</p>
</div>
<p>We have just seen an example of an error correcting code called
<em>repetition code</em>, which is quite inefficient: we had to send five bits
instead of one. In the course, we will see how to design much more
efficient codes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-mathematical-ideas-are-used-to-design-codes">
<h2>What mathematical ideas are used to design codes?</h2>
<p>We will use <em>algebra</em> and, to some extent, <em>geometry</em> and <em>logic</em> to do
this. Coding theorists work with vectors, matrices and projective spaces
over finite fields, polynomials and the Boolean algebra, and we will
see some of these objects in action. We will prove
general facts about codes. We will also see some codes which were used
by NASA to transmit messages to the deep space missions, and codes used
in modern telecommunication networks, alongside more peculiar historical
applications of codes in sports betting.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, while the above serves as a background or
motivation to the study of codes, all the examinable material in this
course is purely mathematical. Students' knowledge of electrical
engineering or sports will not be assessed.</p>
