    <h1>MATH10101 2018/19: Lecturers' response to the unit evaluation questionnaires</h1>

    <p><strong>1. Our message to the 2018/19 students</strong></p>
<p>This course continues to be taught by two lecturers. Prof. Louise Walker
taught the 1st half of the course, and Dr Yuri Bazlov taught the second
half. While the content remained largely unchanged compared to last
year, one important new feature of the course were short feedback
quizzes in lectures. Students were given the opportunity to do a few
Kahoot quizzes after the break between two consecutive lecture hours.
See comments about the quizzes below.</p>
<p><strong>We were glad to see that the students were very eager to ask
questions.</strong> Many students asked questions in lectures, after lectures,
by email, or, towards the end of the semester, in the Online Forum - and
some answered other students' questions in the Forum! This helped to
make sure that the course was an intellectual process of learning, not
(just) of memorising the material.</p>
<p><strong>2. The questionnaire</strong></p>
<p>You were asked to indicate how strongly you agree with statements about
the course, on a scale from 5 (agree), 4 (mostly agree) to 1 (disagree).
We thank everyone who returned their feedback: more than half of
students did so, making the feedback scores (see below) a reliable
indicator of how the course went. The responses were overwhelmingly
positive, with a lot of praise in the textual comments. Here we will
mostly focus on suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, I would rate this unit as being excellent: 4.4 out of 5
(agree: 51%, agree or mostly agree: 92%).</strong></p>
<p>Issued raised in the questionnaires:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Too many theorems/proofs, difficult to learn and practise them all.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an issue which needs to be addressed in two courses,
MATH10101 and MATH10111, simultaneously. A number of students felt
that too much was packed into the course, especially towards the end,
and there were requests to make more time/opportunities available to
practise proofs. This will be under review.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>More examples in lectures please.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This course is supported by supervisions which are designed so that
the students can work through examples. That said, there is never too
many examples in lectures. It may be a good idea to more often
highlight links between the lecture material and the supervision
problem sheets. Students were generally happy with Kahoot quizzes as
an extra source of examples, but...</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Yuri's Kahoot quizzes were two difficult.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A couple of such comments were seen, while no one said they were too
easy! No problem - will review the feedback quizzes to make sure they
can be answered effectively within 30-60 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The feedback that I received on my work was helpful: 4.3 out of 5
(agree: 53%, a/ma: 89%)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The support classes were helpful: 4.4 out of 5 (agree: 61%, a/ma:
86%)</strong></p>
<p>Obviously the students' experience varied between supervision groups,
some praising the style of their supervisor while some others finding it
difficult to adjust to. Weekly supervisions are the main vehicle for
feedback in this course, and there is a lot of value in getting
supervision feedback from someone else than the lecturer. Nevertheless,
despite many positive comments, there is room for improvement in terms
of feedback, and we will continue to improve supervision problem sheets
and work with group supervisors to make sure that students benefit even
more from supervisions.</p>
<p><strong>The unit was well organised: 4.6 out of 5 (agree: 67%, a/ma: 95%)</strong></p>
<p>Glad to see enthusiastic feedback here - running a big course like
MATH10101 is a huge logistical effort.</p>
<p><strong>The course materials were helpful: 4.6 out of 5 (agree: 65%, a/ma:
94%)</strong></p>
<p>In comments, students praised the quality of typed lecture notes and
supervision problem sheets. Some said that the problem sheets were too
easy, and some that they were too hard, but overall it seems that the
level of challenge was right.</p>
<p><strong>The eLearning resources provided in this unit were helpful: 4.2 out of
5 (agree: 47%, a/ma: 78%)</strong></p>
<p>This is the lowest score in the feedback. The students were generally
unhappy with the platform via which the course text, <em>Introduction to
Mathematical Reasoning</em>, was provided. This will be under review.
<strong>UPDATE from Kortext:</strong> as of 2019/20, a PDF source is used for the course
text in the Kortext online platform. [It is of better quality. - <em>YB</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Louise Walker's teaching was excellent: 4.78 out of 5 (agree 78%, a/ma
99% )</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yuri Bazlovâ€™s teaching was excellent: 4.5 out of 5 (agree: 68%, a/ma:
89%)</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback which was overwhelmingly positive.</p>
